    "desc": "The main purpose of this project is to inspire a love for reading among young readers. Children read books, complete associated quizzes, and are rewarded with a \"Chytozavryk\" for their efforts. The platform includes a dashboard for parents, enabling them to register their children, and a separate dashboard for children, which showcases vital information such as the books read, rewards earned, and quizzes completed. Additionally, there is an admin panel for site management.\n\nI joined the project at its midway point. My responsibilities included finalizing the development of the child's dashboard, ensuring seamless integration of its features, and creating the admin panel from scratch. In my capacity as team lead, my duties extended to decomposing the layout into small components, task prioritization, performing code reviews, and overseeing project timelines to ensure timely completion.",
